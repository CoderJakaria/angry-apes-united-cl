        The year is 2080. There are no clouds in the sky and the hot sun is
        shining down on planet Ape Puria. The day started out peaceful and calm.
        Then out of nowhere the sky turned a bright burnt orange and massive
        meteoroids came flying down, crumbling into pieces into the planets
        atmosphere. “Ape Puria is going to be wiped out, everyone run, get to
        the spaceship now!”, screamed an alarmed President Ape. All the apes
        scrambled to the trees swinging from one branch to the next with their
        eyes focused on making it alive to the space shuttle. In lightning speed
        they synchronized their movements and came together like ants at a
        picnic and safely blasted off in the shuttle escaping death. The nearest
        habitable destination was a place 1,500 light years away called planet
        Earth. It must have been their destiny to find this planet earth.
        Nothing could be better for a colony of apes. This planet was engorged
        with the most solid and strong trees with swingable branches and vines
        sure to take them to many beautiful sites on the planet for gathering
        food and building their community. Once the Apes started exploring their
        new home they encountered an ancient abandoned city deep in the jungle.
        It was later found out this quiet city was formerly called Ethia. The
        apes believed it was no accident that they had stumbled upon this city
        in the jungle. To them, it was fate. The apes worked tirelessly for
        years to make this lost city their future home. They grew old and future
        generations only knew of planet earth and the city of Ethia as their
        home. Until one day a little human child went exploring in the jungle.
        The boy stumbled upon Ethia. His eyes wide at the sight of all the apes
        in the jungle. He quickly rushed home to tell his parents what he had
        seen. “Mom! Dad!”, the boy shouted. “I found a city full of apes in the
        jungle”. The boys parents had doubt if their boy was telling the truth
        but were eager to cash in on the possibility of this truth, and reported
        this to the authorities. The authorities sent out a search team of their
        most highly intelligent humans who found the city of the apes. A battle
        broke out. The humans began firing their weapons and killing the apes
        off one by one. The apes became furious. The humans were not sorry for
        killing the apes. The apes became very angry and fought back shouting
        “FOR ETHIA!” The apes were not going to lose another home. This is where
        the great human ape war began.
